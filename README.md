# Pandalyzer



## Introduction

### The goal

These days, programming language Python is gaining lots of popularity among data scientists. One of the reasons is its
simple syntax and relatively shallow learning curve. Over the years, many packages were developed trying to make
data science and data manipulation in python easy and efficient, of which the most well known is a library called
Pandas. However, due to the dynamic nature of Python, it is easy to make mistakes in code, that will not be spotted
before the program is actually run, and it fails in runtime. 

The goal of Pandalyzer is to spot some of these mistakes in a common Pandas code before the execution of the program 
actually starts.

### Used technologies
- Python language
  - ast and ast2json libraries (abstract syntax tree) for parsing the python code and converting it to json format
- Kotlin language for the analysis itself
